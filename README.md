# GSE Market Pulse: Financial Analysis of Risk, Liquidity, and Conviction (2021-2023)

## 1. Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive financial assessment of securities on the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) between 2021 and 2023. Moving beyond simple returns, the analysis focuses on three core investment decision factors: Risk-Adjusted Return, Liquidity, and Trading Conviction.

The findings are based on rigorous data cleaning and the application of industry-standard financial metrics.

## 2. Key Business Questions & Findings

### A. Risk-Adjusted Return (Sharpe Ratio)

**Question:** Which companies deliver the best performance for the level of risk undertaken?

| Rank | Company Name | Sharpe Ratio | Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1 (Top)** | **Benso Oil Palm Plantation Plc (BOPP)** | **+3.06** | **Superior Risk Management.** Provided the most efficient return while controlling volatility. |
| **2** | Enterprise Group PLC (EGL) | +2.69 | Highly efficient and stable performance. |
| **Bottom** | Unilever Ghana PLC (UNIL) | -1.45 | **Value Erosion.** High risk coupled with substantial net losses. |

### B. Liquidity and Trading Costs (Average Relative Spread)

**Question:** Which companies are the most expensive or cheapest to trade instantly?

| Rank | Company Name | Avg. Relative Spread | Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1 (Most Liquid)** | **Trust Bank Limited (The Gambia) (TBL)** | **6.03%** | **Excellent Liquidity.** Cheapest stock to trade, highly attractive for large orders. |
| **2** | MTN Ghana PB (MTNGH) | 21.93% | Good liquidity, reflecting high market interest. |
| **Bottom (Worst)** | **Digicut Production & Advertising Limited (DIGICUT)** | **113.30%** | **Extreme Trading Barrier.** The cost to execute a trade exceeds the share's price, rendering the stock functionally untradeable. |

### C. Trading Conviction (Volume-Price Correlation)

**Question:** Which price movements are trustworthy and confirmed by trading volume?

| Rank | Company Name | Correlation | Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1 (Highest Conviction)** | **Trust Bank Limited (The Gambia) (TBL)** | **+0.96** | **Highly Reliable Trends.** Price moves are strongly supported by volume. |
| **2** | Guinness Ghana Breweries Plc (GGBL) | +0.15 | Weak positive relationship, some trend confirmation. |
| **Bottom** | Cocoa Processing Company Limited (CPC) | -0.22 | **Noise-Driven Market.** Price movements are unreliable and often contradicted by volume. |

## 3. Recommendations

### For Investors
* **Allocate Capital:** Prioritize stocks in the top tiers of Sharpe Ratio (BOPP, EGL) and Liquidity (TBL, MTNGH).
* **Avoid Illiquid Stocks:** Immediately review any holdings with an **Average Relative Spread above 50%**, as the cost to exit these positions will severely erode capital gains.

### For Regulators
* **Structural Review:** Address the extreme illiquidity of stocks like DIGICUT. Market policies should be considered for stocks where trading costs exceed the share price, potentially leading to delisting to improve the quality of the main exchange.
* **Data Integrity:** Investigate the underlying cause of mathematical impossibilities found in certain stock metrics (e.g., -6115% return), which are signs of fundamental data recording issues.
